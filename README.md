## Project 1: CavemanParty
<a name="project-1"></a>
Description: A Django Project made for me and my friends. My friend wanted to host a party and have a unique RSVP website. This website consisted of a form that allowed users to register for a specific caveman. The caveman type was taken from a database that I created. The database only allowed for one type of caveman, so each individual was unique. Then the website showed the results of the form: the individual's name and their caveman. I deployed the application through AWS using an EC2 instance.

## Project 2: Avalanche Education Application
<a name="project-2"></a>
Description: A Qt Application made by a team of myself and three others. The application consists of 3 modules, each ending with a quiz to test the knowledge retention of the users. I coded in C++, CSS, and used the Box2D library.

## Project 3: Sprite Editor
<a name="project-3"></a>
Description: A Qt Application made by a team of myself and three others. The editor consists of seven different tools: pen, rectangle, circle, line, fill-bucket, eraser, and color picker. Additionally, users can add and delete frames to their sprite, save their work, and load their work.

## Project 4: Simon Game
<a name="project-4"></a>
Description: A Qt Application made by myself. The application consists of 3 different colored buttons. Once the start button is pressed, the buttons flash, and the users have to press the colored buttons back in the same order they flashed. If the sequence is executed out correctly another flash will be added to the sequence. Otherwise, the game ends and the user can start over with a new sequence.
